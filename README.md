<h1 align = 'center'><strong>01. Tourist Attraction </strong></h1>

Whenever you travel it is fun to make a list of places you want to visit.  The application consists of 7 files. My app can store user input data to show.

- Within each category you will have the option to move a location up to the next category and also remove a location.
- There is also the option to add new locations to any of the categories.

The application here looks at making this list and organizing locations into 3 categories:
   1. **Recommended places** to visit, 
   2. **decided places** to visit and 
   3. places that have been **visited**.

<h1 align = 'center'><strong>02. Pet Adoption Site </strong></h1>  

  On the pet adoption website, you browse through the categories of animals and select the one you‚Äôre interested in, which brings you to another page that contains a list of available pets. Then, you continue your search by further clicking on an individual pet to view its profile page.

In this project, I've used Python‚Äôs Flask framework to create a simple pet adoption site that contains multiple routes.
